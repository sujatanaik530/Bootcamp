(1) Create database userdb. (If userdb already exists, delete tables student, course and student_course.)
(2) Use easier to type email "user@gmail.com" and password "up123" (or "sn@gmail.com" and "sn123").
(3) Before you run the unit test, make sure you have run the application once and the tables (specifically Student) are still there.
